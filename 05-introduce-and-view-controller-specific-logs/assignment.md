    You explored how the CRD was generated, and you have cluster that knows about your Website custom resources kind.

    Now it is time to understand the generated controller. You will get to see your application respond to a request for a Website custom resource.

    **In this challenge you will:**
    * Add logs in your controller application
    * Run the application locally
    * Request a Website custom resource and view the corresponding logs

üïµÔ∏è Understanding how the controller is created
==============

When you selected to create a controller along with the Resource, Kubebuilder took care of some key setup:

1. Start the controller process during application boot
1. Implement a custom `Reconcile` function run on each resource event
1. Configure the controller to know which resource events to listen to

To see the start process, navigate to `main.go:92` in the root of your `Code editor`. You will see a section that starts the website controller:

```
if err = (&controllers.WebsiteReconciler{
  Client: mgr.GetClient(),
  Scheme: mgr.GetScheme(),
}).SetupWithManager(mgr); err != nil {
  setupLog.Error(err, "unable to create controller", "controller", "Website")
  os.Exit(1)
}
```

This is a call to the function `SetupWithManager(mgr)` which is defined in the file `controllers/website_controller.go`.

Navigate to `controllers/website_controller.go:58` to view this function already configured to know about the CRD `kubeconv1beta1.Website`. This is an example of why defining the custom resource in Golang is so helpful. The `kubeconv1beta1.Website` is the Golang resource type which you explored in the last challenge.

Finally, look a bit further up in that same `website_controller.go` file to see how the `func (r *WebsiteReconciler) Reconcile` function has been generated. This is left nearly empty as this is where the core of your business logic will be added.

While this is an error free implementation, you wouldn't really be able to tell if it worked since there are no side effects for running the `Reconcile` function, not even any logs!

ü™µ Logging from the controller
==============

In order to make it more obvious when the `Reconcile` function is called, add a simple log line.

To do this, replace the contents of the current function (lines 50 to 54) with the below text:

```
  // _ indicates an unused variable in Golang.
  // By naming the variable, you can use the pre-configured logging framework.
  log := log.FromContext(ctx)

  // Start by declaring the custom resource to be type "Website"
  customResource := &kubeconv1beta1.Website{}

  // Then retrieve from the cluster the resource that triggered this reconciliation.
  // The contents of this resource are then stored into an object used throughout reconciliation.
  err := r.Client.Get(context.Background(), req.NamespacedName, customResource)
  // If the resource cannot be translated into a "Website" resource type, return failure.
  if err != nil {
    return ctrl.Result{}, err
  }

  log.Info("Hello from your new website reconciler!")

  return ctrl.Result{}, nil
```

**üíæ Once this change is complete. Remember to save the file with `ctrl+s` (or `‚åò + s` on a mac).**

What this code snipped does is:

1. Assign the logger to a variable
1. Tests the ability to read the Website CRD, erroring if it is invalid
1. If the CRD is valid, writes a log line
1. Continues on to return healthy at the end of the reconcile loop


üèÉüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running your application locally
==============

You may have noticed a third tab on this challenge called `Run Shell`&mdash;you will use this for a long-running process. It is just another session on the same machine, so the only difference between it and the `K8s Shell` tab is the title!

In the `Run Shell` tab, start up your newly updated application with:

```
make run
```

Remember, this may take a few minutes.

When it completes you should see the same output you saw in the last challenge which shows the starting of both a metrics and health probe endpoint.

But you should also see new log lines showing the starting of the website controller as well:

```
INFO    Starting EventSource    {"controller": "website", "controllerGroup": "kubecon.my.domain", "controllerKind": "Website", "source": "kind source: *v1beta1.Website"}
INFO    Starting Controller     {"controller": "website", "controllerGroup": "kubecon.my.domain", "controllerKind": "Website"}
INFO    Starting workers        {"controller": "website", "controllerGroup": "kubecon.my.domain", "controllerKind": "Website", "worker count": 1}
```

This is the starting of the controller process, but `Reconcile` will only run and print your log line when a `Website` Resource is created.

üëÄ Request a website
==============

In the `K8s Shell` tab, request a Custom Resource of type `Website`. It is easiest to use the generated sample file available in the `Code editor` tab under `./config/samples/kubecon_v1beta1_website.yaml`.

To use this file, apply it to the Kubernetes cluster with:

```
kubectl apply \
  --filename ./config/samples/kubecon_v1beta1_website.yaml
```

Once this is applied, return to the `Run Shell` tab and have a look for your log output:

```
INFO    Hello from your new website reconciler! ...
```

Any time you interact with your Website resources and trigger an event, you will see another printing of the log line from your application.

In order to progress, have one (and only one) Website resource in your cluster before pressing the `Check` button. This will set you up for success on future challenges.

üìï Summary
==============

Congratulations, you have officially triggered a Website reconciliation by requesting a Website resource!

Next up, you will look at how to change the CRD fields and use these custom fields in your controller reconciliation.
