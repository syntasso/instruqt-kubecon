  contents: "# A true playground \U0001F6DD\n\nSo far, this course has focused on
    a specific implementation to cover all the key parts of the hackathon setup.\n\nThis
    includes:\n* Creating platform APIs using community Promises\n* Using resources
    provided by Platform APIs\n* Customising APIs to business-specific requirements\n*
    Providing a Backstage portal as a user-friendly interface\n* Managing resources
    during and after the hackathon as a fleet\n\nThis next section is not guided.
    It is just the environment, fully set up from the previous work and ready to be
    explored. Feel free to spend as little or as much time as you want here, but remember,
    customisations only live for the duration of a single session, and upon return,
    the environment will start fresh again."
