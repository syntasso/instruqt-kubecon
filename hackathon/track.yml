title: CloudNative Hackathon
teaser: Learn how to build a platform to host a hackathon for any size organisation
description: |-
  In this workshop learn about our experiences running a company-wide hackathon at The Access Group using only open source software, which not only launched innovative business ideas but also created a whole new awareness and adoption of cloud native technologies.

  Get hands-on today with creating effective developer experience using a Backstage Portal, managing infrastructure, and everything in between. Most importantly, this session results in a working platform blueprint to take back ready for hacking in your own organisation.

  This is a workshop built for [KubeCon EU 2025](https://sched.co/1tx6e).
