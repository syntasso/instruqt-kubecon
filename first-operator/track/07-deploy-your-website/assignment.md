🕵🏿 Some new setup to review
==============

Since you finished the last challenge, a change has been made to your operator.

Navigate to `controllers/website_controller.go` in your `Code editor` tab and scroll all the way to the bottom. Here you should find a new function called `newDeployment`.

This new function encapsulates the how to create a customized deployment for your website.

While this function was defined for you, you still need to use it in the Reconcile loop.

✍🏾 Creating a deployment in the reconcile loop
==============

This `newDeployment` function can return an error, and the following snippet handles that error. Navigate in the `Code editor` tab to the `controllers/website_controller.go` file. This snippet should be added directly below the log line you edited in the last challenge (around line 73):
```
  // Attempt to create the deployment and return error if it fails
  err = r.Client.Create(ctx, newDeployment(customResource.Name, customResource.Namespace, customResource.Spec.ImageTag))
  if err != nil {
    log.Error(err, fmt.Sprintf(`Failed to create deployment for website "%s"`, customResource.Name))
    return ctrl.Result{}, err
  }
```

**💾 Once this change is complete. Remember to save the file with `ctrl+s` (or `⌘ + s` on a mac).**

🛂 Permissions for the operator
==============

It is all well and good to tell the operator to create a deployment, but is it allowed? In Kubernetes there is strict role based access control (RBAC) that limits what actions people and applications can take.

With this new change, we now need allow the operator to work with deployments. Kubebuilder provides a mechanism to do this through powerful comments, much like those used in the CRD fields.

Look near the top of the `controllers/website_controller.go` file in the `Code editor` tab for comment lines that start with `//+kubebuilder:rbac` (around line 45). Each line describes a single RBAC permission.

To provide access to work with deployments, you need to add the following permission line:
```
//+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=apps,resources=deployments,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
```

**💾 Once this change is complete. Remember to save the file with `ctrl+s` (or `⌘ + s` on a mac).**

Kubebuilder translates this change into necessary service accounts when you build the deployment.

> 💡 Note that this is a broad permission since it allows all verbs. These can be limited when tighter security is necessary.

🧞 Creating a deployment for your current website
==============

Since you created a Website resource earlier, this should still be in your cluster.

Confirm this by running the following command in the `K8s Shell` tab:
```
kubectl get websites.kubecon.my.domain
```

You should see something like:
```
NAME             AGE
website-sample   26m
```

With this already in your cluster, when you start up your operator again it will reconcile immediately. During reconciliation the operator will try to create a deployment as you have defined.

To see this, go to the `Run Shell` tab and start the operator again with:
```
make run
```

You should see the same log lines as before including the reference to `latest` imageTag.

Once you see this log go back to the `K8s Shell` tab and check for deployments with:
```
kubectl get deployments
```

You should now see a single deployment with 2 replicas starting.
```
READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
website-sample   2/2     2            2           61s
```

> 💡 To see more details about this deployment, run `kubectl describe deployment`. You can look for configurations that the `newDeployment` function set like number of `Replicas` and `Labels`.

🧨 But what happens on update?
==============

While creating a deployment is an exciting and real world use case for your operator, what happens on update?

Test this by stopping and restarting your operator. To stop you operator go to the `Run Shell` tab and use `ctrl+c`. Then restart with the same `make run` command you used before.

You will see the log line but then an error trace something like:

```
ERROR   Failed to create deployment     {"controller": "website", ... "error": "deployments.apps \"website-sample\" already exists"}
sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/internal/controller.(*Controller).Reconcile
        /root/go/pkg/mod/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.12.2/pkg/internal/controller/controller.go:121
sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/internal/controller.(*Controller).reconcileHandler
        /root/go/pkg/mod/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.12.2/pkg/internal/controller/controller.go:320
sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/internal/controller.(*Controller).processNextWorkItem
        /root/go/pkg/mod/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.12.2/pkg/internal/controller/controller.go:273
sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/internal/controller.(*Controller).Start.func2.2
        /root/go/pkg/mod/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.12.2/pkg/internal/controller/controller.go:234
```

That is because the code asks to create a deployment, but there already is one in the cluster. Next you will see how to deal with this issue.

> 💡These log lines will repeat a lot because the reconcile loop retries on failure. This is fine to leave, but you can use `ctrl+c` again to stop them if it is distracting.

📕 Summary
==============

In this challenge you added a more realistic use case for your operator by asking it to deploy a website for you.

But this quickly resulted in more things to do (🥁) to handle when a deployment already exists. Don't worry, that is coming up next!
